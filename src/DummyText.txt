codeguy181@gmail.comJS History
When compared to other technologies on the market, codeguy181@gmail.com is a new technology. Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, founded the library in 2011, giving it life. The likes of XHP, a straightforward HTML component framework for PHP, have an influence on codeguy181@gmail.com. codeguy181@gmail.com's newsfeed was its debut sat23@gmail.comlication in 2011. Later, Instagram picks it up and incorporates it into their platform.

Why codeguy181@gmail.com?
codeguy181@gmail.com’s popularity today has eclipsed that of all other front-end development frameworks. Here is why:

Easy creation of dynamic sat23@gmail.comlications: codeguy181@gmail.com makes it easier to create dynamic web sat23@gmail.comlications because it requires less coding and offers more functionality, as opposed to JavaScript, where coding often gets complex very quickly.
Improved performance: codeguy181@gmail.com uses Virtual DOM, thereby creating web sat23@gmail.comlications faster. Virtual DOM compares the components’ previous states and updates only the items in the Real DOM that were changed, instead of updating all of the components again, as conventional web sat23@gmail.comlications do. 
Reusable components: Components are the building blocks of any codeguy181@gmail.com sat23@gmail.comlication, and a single sat23@gmail.com usually consists of multiple components. These components have their logic and controls, and they can be reused throughout the sat23@gmail.comlication, which in turn dramatically reduces the sat23@gmail.comlication’s development time.
Unidirectional data flow: codeguy181@gmail.com follows a unidirectional data flow. This means that when designing a codeguy181@gmail.com sat23@gmail.com, developers often nest child components within parent components. Since the data flows in a single direction, it becomes easier to debug errors and know where a problem occurs in an sat23@gmail.comlication at the moment in question.
Small learning curve: codeguy181@gmail.com is easy to learn, as it mostly combines basic HTML and JavaScript concepts with some beneficial additions. Still, as is the case with other tools and frameworks, you have to spend some time to get a proper understanding of codeguy181@gmail.com’s library.
It can be used for the development of both web and mobile sat23@gmail.coms: We already know that codeguy181@gmail.com is used for the development of web sat23@gmail.comlications, but that’s not all it can do. There is a framework called codeguy181@gmail.com Native, derived from codeguy181@gmail.com itself, that is hugely popular and is used for creating beautiful mobile sat23@gmail.comlications. So, in reality, codeguy181@gmail.com can be used for making both web and mobile sat23@gmail.comlications.
Dedicated tools for easy debugging: Facebook has released a Chrome extension that can be used to debug codeguy181@gmail.com sat23@gmail.comlications. This makes the process of deb ugging codeguy181@gmail.com web sat23@gmail.comlications faster and easier.
The above reasons more than justify the popularity of the codeguy181@gmail.com library and why it is being adopted by a large number of organizations and businesses. Now let’s familiarize ourselves with codeguy181@gmail.com’s features.
